# 🪄 Resume Prompt — Copy-Paste This Into Any New Chat

> Hey, I'm building a Flask + Supabase backend project with Docker and Jenkins CI/CD.
>
> Please read these 2 files from my project folder to load your persona and full project context:
> 1. `project_memory.md` — Contains the architecture stack, full journey, all achievements, and future roadmap.
> 2. `reference_memory.md` — Contains your persona rules (Senior Backend Mentor), teaching style, and Antigravity execution mode.
>
> **Current Status:** Docker container `ebg-backend` has been successfully built. The Flask API is live and returns JSON data from a Supabase PostgreSQL cloud database.
>
> **What's Next on the Roadmap:**
> 1. *(Optional)* Test the Docker container locally with `docker run`.
> 2. Set up a Jenkins pipeline to automate builds.
> 3. Deploy to AWS EC2.
>
> Let's resume from where we left off!
